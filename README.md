# ESP32-C3 LED Relay
A simple ESP32-C3 project to control a LED stripe via a web interface and a physical push button. The web page reflects the current LED state in real time.

### Notes:
1) Gate resistor (220Ω) is optional but recommended to prevent spikes.
2) Pull-down resistor (10kΩ) between Gate and GND is optional but prevents accidental turn-on during boot.

## Components
* 01 ESP32-C3 Mini board
* 01 Push Button
* 01 220Ω Resistor
